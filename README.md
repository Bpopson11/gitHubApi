# _GitHub Search_

#### _Using a GitHub API this app allows the user to search GitHub by username._

#### By _**Bri Popson**_

## Description

_The purpose of this app is to allow the user to search GitHub. A viable search of a username will return that user's avatar picture, their name, location if it's there, and the dates of when this specific user created their GitHub account and the last time they updated anything in their repository. In addition the app will return a column of the searched user's public repositories in alphabeticall order. At this time it will return only the first 30 repositories but in the searceed user's profile a link to their GitHub profile is available._

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* _Fork or clone from GitHub_
* _Please create a separate branch if you cloned_
* _Open the folder in a text editor like Atom to view the code_
* _In a terminal on your comuter like Terminal(Apple) or GitBash(Microsoft) insert "npm install" in the top level of the project folder.
* _Next run "bower install". All appropriate files will be installed based on JSON files saved in the code._
* _While still in the top level of the project folder, type "guilp buildAll" followed by "gulp serve". This will open the page up in whatever internet brower you were using last._

## Known Bugs
_Sometimes building the data seems to take one or more tries. If the browser loads and there's no styling on the page, please cancel the server using ctrl + c and run the "buildAll" command again, then run "gulp serve"._

## Technologies Used

_This app was built in Javascript using Node.js, Bower, Gulp, and Sass_
